Difficult: 
1. Given an array of integers, write a Java program to find the maximum sum of two integers in the array.

For example in an array like this:
[2, 3, 1, 5, 4]
The maximum sum would be 5 + 4

Very difficult
2. Fill the array with human names.

["Oskars", "Anna", "Andris"]
Result: 3

["Andris", "Oskars", "Elizabeth", "Oskars",  "Elizabeth"]

["Oskars"] - An empty array
Result: 1
